    <h1>Welcome to David Onyemauche Azubuike's WDD 130 Website.</h1>
    <p>My name is David Onyemauche Azubuike. I am a software development student at BYU–Idaho with a growing skill set
        in front-end web development, version control (Git/GitHub), and user-centered design.</p>
    <p> I previously worked in industrial maintenance and engineering environments, which has strengthened my analytical
        thinking, problem-solving, and precision. I bring an engineering mindset into software development and am
        committed to building clean, functional, and scalable solutions.
