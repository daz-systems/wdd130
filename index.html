            <p>
                My name is David Onyemauche Azubuike. <br>
                I am a software development student at BYU–Idaho with a growing skill set
                in front-end web development, version control (Git/GitHub), and user-centered design.
            </p>

            <p>
                I previously worked in industrial maintenance and engineering environments,
                which has strengthened my analytical thinking, problem-solving, and precision. <br>
                I bring an engineering mindset into software development and am
                committed to building clean, functional, and scalable solutions.
